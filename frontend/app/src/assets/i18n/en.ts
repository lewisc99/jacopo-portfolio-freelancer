        'Systemic-semiotic consultancy to develop social content for Personal Branding and Brand Activism.',
      text: `I am Jacopo Giancaspro, I am 27 years old, and I am a semiotician. For the methodology I adopt,
       I have drawn inspiration from various cultural, interpretive, and structural semiotic approaches,
        along with elements of systemic psychology. Through semi-structured interviews, I allow the professional to speak freely,
         in order to enable them to improve their narrative thinking skills, emotional intelligence, and empathy. The content elicited through
          the interviews is authentic and not a result of forced storytelling; it is recorded and explored in further detail, proposed on social platforms of the professionals.
           A personal branding strategy helps effectively channel one's own content. The goal is to make individuals autonomous on social media, without ever obligating them to publish 
           or imposing specific content. All proposed material is subject to prior approval by the involved person. On a narrative level, it is possible to trace isotopies
            (semantic redundancies / recurring elements), some conscious and others less so on the part of the subject, to outline 5 specific spheres for each professional
             in communicating their own personal brand. The individual's spheres should be considered as interconnected textual elements. I use an operational practice to
              empathize with the subject and provide practical and effective support for any form of work performance. The constructive and collaborative reciprocal exchange 
              allows for a surplus of meaning, not merely a sum of knowledge; the dialogic aspect that leads to continuous subject/analyst feedback will guide the analysis towards
               intrinsic polyphony. Therefore, a holistic analytical approach is important. - Interviews are conducted remotely, but it would be desirable to conduct them in person as well,
                to understand how the subject reacts to diamesic variations.\n
                

      `,
      textPartTwo: `The average duration is 30 minutes, plus a moment dedicated to further discussion with the subject after digesting the conversation.
      Interviews are conducted in the professional's native language, as language is a primary shaping system; if not possible, Italian or English is used. This leads to understanding at a metadiscursive level:
      The awareness that the subject exhibits during and after the sessions and their degree of verbalization of a previously expressed (or emerged but not consciously) issue;
      How to channel the professional's creativity into empathic content;
      The needs of professionals requiring support, through this preliminary semiotic investigation. With applied semiotics, my commitment is to provide a qualitative contribution to the professional's communication.`,
